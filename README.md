# UTB-Advanced-Programming-Course-Project
In this project i will make a Hotel Management System using Python as programming launguage, 
Tkinter for UI and 
sqlite3 for database 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this program user can ask questions like:

* Can I check in?
* Can I check out?
* Can I get info about rooms?
* Can I get info about guests?
* Can I order sth to drink or eat?
* Can I call housecleaning
* Can I see and pay my bill?

 and depend on the choosed operation, user can proceed with the process.

# CONCLUSION

In the end, I made all the things i wanted to make. Using a database and working with it was easier than I thought.

Although my database is pretty simple, i learned a lot of stuff. In the end, I think I didn't choose the best options for my project.

Because it was mostly me bare programming everything. 

So i am sure there are better options for doing the same work as both a programming language and a GUI library. Overall, it was good learning and implementing by me.

And lastly, about the time it takes:

I mostly followed the timetable without a problem.

It took me approximately 20 hours + 20h(class hours) = nearly 40h. Because the instructor didn't want us to  exceed the time given I will leave the project as it is. I could've realized the program faster. But because I don't have the knowledge of some features it took me some extra time. 

And that's all there is.
